## Introduction

This project was thought as part of the Full Stack Software Development course offered by Code Institute Ireland.

The goal of this memory card game is to offer to users who have some interest in Brazilian culture and like ‘memes’ (or other funny contents) a little bit of the humor in the form of very fast memory card game, which users can find in any online journal or magazine.

The users can play this memory card while they are going or coming back to and from work, or during small pauses during the day or while relaxing at home. 
Hopefully, this game can spark some interest from online media companies and offer to users the chance to take a fun pause.

## UX

### Overview

The game was developed so that it can be inserted in some online media communication media (e-journal, e-magazines) or even become an application, to entertain the user in a moment of pause.

### Why a Memory Card Game?

The idea behind the Memory Card Game project came from the need for people to have a small moment of distraction without the need to be connected all the time on social networks. 
As an Internet user, I have always been very connected to social networks, which have become big "department stores" that bombard us all the time with products and services. 
In the case of this memory game, the user can interact with his gadget, have some fun, without having to scroll the screen to avoid advertisements. 


### Key Project Goals

I would like to provide the users with an entertaining moment, of quick interaction, so that they have a good experience on the weblog and also to avoid a possible fast bounce rate, since the blog is monetized.
So, by using the jog, the user would stay longer inside my site.

2. #### _Scope Plane_
